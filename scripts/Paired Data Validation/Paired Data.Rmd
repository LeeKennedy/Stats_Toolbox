This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data.in <- read.csv("Book2.csv", header=TRUE)
library(dplyr)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# Determines the effect size between two sets of data.
cohens_d <- function(x, y) {
        lx <- length(x)- 1
        ly <- length(y)- 1
        md  <- abs(mean(x) - mean(y))
        csd <- lx * var(x) + ly * var(y)
        csd <- csd/(lx + ly)
        csd <- sqrt(csd)
        
        cd  <- md/csd   ## cohen's d
}
```


```{r}
data.in <- data.in[1:15,]

t1 <- data.in$A
t2 <- data.in$B
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(t1, t2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
t.test(t2, t1, paired = TRUE)
```


```{r}
aa <- cohens_d(data.in$A, data.in$B)
round(aa,2)
```
